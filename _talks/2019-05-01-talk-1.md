The UTM Graduate Research Colloquium aims to highlight graduate student research across our campus. This special two-day event provided the opportunity for graduate students to showcase their work to fellow graduate students, post-docs, and faculty from all graduate departments. The Colloquium also provided a fantastic opportunity to learn about the most exciting graduate research taking place at UTM. This event was also open to St. George students that have a supervisor who has a continuing appointment at UTM.
