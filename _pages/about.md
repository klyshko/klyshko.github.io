<img src="/images/ezgif-3-e1da36ca2200.gif" alt="md" width="130px" align="left" style="padding:7px;"> I have received a PhD degree in Physics from the University of Toronto, where I worked with [Dr. Sarah Rauscher](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cps/faculty-staff/rauscher-sarah) exploring protein structure-dynamics-function paradigm using molecular simulations. In my research, I extensively used statistical methods, machine learning, and high-performance computing to analyze and understand multidimensional biological datasets. Here you can [read about my PhD research](/research/) and find [the list of selected publications](/publications/).

I’m currently seeking for industry roles with a focus on applying computational modeling and machine learning to tackle complex problems, especially in science and healthcare. I’m passionate about contributing to projects that benefit society or help protect the environment. If you think I could be a valuable addition to your team, please feel free to reach out!

<img src="/images/teach.jpeg" alt="md" width="130px" align="left" style="padding:7px;"> In addition to research, I was always passionate about teaching and mentoring. I find it rewarding to explain complex concepts to various audiences. Over the years, I had the opportunity to teach several university courses and lead workshops in physics, mathematics, and programming. The fusion of these disciplines creates a powerful tool to understand the world around us and expand the limits of curiosity.
