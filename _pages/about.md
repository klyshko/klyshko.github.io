I am working towards my PhD degree in [Dr. Sarah Rauscher's Lab](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cps/faculty-staff/rauscher-sarah) at the University of Toronto. [More info on my research](/research/)



I am a member of [HLML](https://hlml-toronto.github.io) (Humans Leaning Machine Learning) group at the University of Toronto Department of Physics. This is a secret society of machine learning enthusiasts that spend Fridays studying interesting algorithms and some of the  weekends participating in hackathons and kaggle contests.
