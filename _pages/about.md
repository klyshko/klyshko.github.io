<img src="/images/logo1.png" alt="md" width="130px" align="right" style="padding:10px;"> I am a member of [HLML](https://hlml-toronto.github.io) (Humans Leaning Machine Learning) group at the University of Toronto Department of Physics. This is a secret society of machine learning enthusiasts that spend Fridays studying interesting algorithms and some of the  weekends participating in hackathons and kaggle contests.
