Enthusiastic researcher in computational biophysics that uses the powers of machine learning, statistics, and high performance computing. I am working towards my PhD degree in [Dr. Sarah Rauscher's Lab](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cps/faculty-staff/rauscher-sarah) at the University of Toronto. [More about research](/research/)

<img src="/images/logo1.png" alt="md" width="180px" align="right" style="padding:10px;"> I am a member of [HLML](https://hlml-toronto.github.io) (Humans Leaning Machine Learning) group at the University of Toronto Department of Physics. This is a secret society of machine learning enthusiasts that spend Fridays studying interesting algorithms and some of the  weekends participating in hackathons and kaggle contests.
