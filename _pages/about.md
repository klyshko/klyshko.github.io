Hi, I’m Eugene. I enjoy solving complex problems at the intersection of science, technology, and healthcare, and I’m passionate about contributing to projects that benefit society. 

Currently, I am an ML Scientist at [Fable Therapeutics](https://www.fabletherapeutics.com/), where I work on applying machine learning to design novel antibody-based drugs that improve metabolic health. My previous role in biotech includes computational design of peptide-based therapeutics at [Menten.ai](https://www.menten.ai/). In R&D roles at [Denti.ai](https://www.denti.ai/) and [NeuroopticDx](https://neuroopticdx.com/), I built computer-vision and time-series models for AI-based diagnostics and analysis of physiological data. 

I hold a PhD in Physics from the University of Toronto, where I worked with [Dr. Sarah Rauscher](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cps/faculty-staff/rauscher-sarah). My research investigated fundamental properties of protein molecules using molecular simulations, with the goal of better understanding the relationships between protein structure, dynamics, function, and environment. That work relied on statistical analysis, machine learning, and high-performance computing to process complex, time-dependent biological data. You can learn more about my [PhD research here](/research/) and explore a [selection of my publications](/publications/).

I like breaking down technical topics for diverse audiences. I had opportunities to teach university-level courses and lead workshops in physics, mathematics, programming, and [machine learning](https://hlml-toronto.github.io/). Check out [selected tutorials](/teaching/) from my role as a course instructor for [Computational Modeling in Physics](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/phy426h5) at the University of Toronto.

Outside of work, I’m an avid triathlete. You’ll likely find me on the road, track, or in the water training with the [University of Toronto Triathlon Club](https://uofttriathlon.com/).
