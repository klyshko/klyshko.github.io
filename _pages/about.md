<img src="/images/ezgif-3-e1da36ca2200.gif" alt="md" width="130px" align="left" style="padding:7px;"> I am a PhD candidate in Physics in [Dr. Sarah Rauscher's Lab](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cps/faculty-staff/rauscher-sarah) at the University of Toronto, where we study protein dynamics using molecular simulations. In my research, I extensively employ machine learning, statistical methods, and high-performance computing. [More about research](/research/).

<img src="/images/teach.jpeg" alt="md" width="130px" align="left" style="padding:7px;"> In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching and worked as a course instructor for [Computational Modeling in Physics](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/phy426h5). Over the years, I had the opportunity to teach various university courses and lead workshops in physics, mathematics, programming, and chemistry. The fusion of all these disciplines creates a powerful tool to understand the world around us. [Find my selected tutorials](/teaching/)
