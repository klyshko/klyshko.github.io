Hi – I’m Eugene. I love solving complex problems at the intersection of science, technology, and healthcare, and I’m happiest when my work benefits society. I'm an ML Scientist at [Fable](https://www.fabletherapeutics.com/), where I apply generative models to design novel antibody-based drugs aimed at improving metabolic health. Before Fable, I worked on *in silico* peptide therapeutics design at [Menten.ai](https://www.menten.ai/) and built tools for AI diagnostics at [Denti.ai](https://www.denti.ai/) and [NeuroopticDx](https://neuroopticdx.com/). 

I hold a PhD in Physics from the University of Toronto (supervisor: [Dr. Sarah Rauscher](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cps/faculty-staff/rauscher-sarah)). In my research, I investigated fundamental properties of protein molecules in various environements using molecular simulations, with the goal of better understanding the relationships between protein structure, dynamics and function. That work relied on statistical analysis, machine learning, and high-performance computing for understanding large, time-dependent biological data. You can read more about my [PhD research](/research/) or look through [publications](/publications/).

I enjoy teaching and breaking down technical topics for diverse audiences. I've taught university courses and run workshops on mathematical modeling, programming, and [machine learning](https://hlml-toronto.github.io/). See [a few of my tutorials](/teaching/) from the [Computational Modeling in Physics](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/phy426h5) course at U of T.

Outside my work, I’m an avid triathlete – you’ll often find me training with the [University of Toronto Triathlon Club](https://uofttriathlon.com/) on the road, track, or in the water.  If you want to collaborate or just chat about science, code, or training plans, get in touch. My CV is available [here](/cv/).
