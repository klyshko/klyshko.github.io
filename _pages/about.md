Hi, I’m Eugene! With expertise in computational modeling and machine learning, I enjoy solving complex problems, particularly in science, technology and healthcare. I’m passionate about contributing to projects that benefit society. If you are interested in connecting, please feel free to reach out! [Find my resume](/cv/)

I hold a PhD in Physics from the University of Toronto, where I worked with [Dr. Sarah Rauscher](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cps/faculty-staff/rauscher-sarah) to investigate protein structure, dynamics, and function using molecular simulations. My research relied heavily on statistical analysis, machine learning, and high-performance computing to gain insights from complex biological datasets. You can learn more about my [PhD research here](/research/) and explore a [selection of my publications](/publications/).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I’ve had the opportunity to work in the biotech sector. At [Menten.ai](https://www.menten.ai/), I contributed to developing computational protein design methods, exploring classical, quantum, and quantum-inspired approaches. I also expanded my skills in computer vision and data science at [Denti.ai](https://www.denti.ai/), a healthcare startup focusing on dental diagnostics using automated X-ray image analysis.

I enjoy teaching and mentoring, in particular, I like breaking down complex topics for diverse audiences. I have taught university-level courses and led workshops in physics, mathematics, programming, and [machine learning](https://hlml-toronto.github.io/). Check out some of my [selected tutorials](/teaching/), including materials from my role as a course instructor for [Computational Modeling in Physics](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/phy426h5) at the University of Toronto.

Outside of work, I’m an avid triathlete. You’ll likely find me on the road, track, or in the water training with the awesome community of the [University of Toronto Triathlon Club](https://uofttriathlon.com/).
